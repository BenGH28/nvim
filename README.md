## Porting Everything to Lua because why not?

works for the most part still some stuff missing like snippets and other niceties.

## Install

clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim` for now.  Working on a nice install script to autoinstall some lsps when you install this config.

## Dependencies/Life Improvements

- This config benefits from [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git), to please your eyes, I recommend downloading one of those.
